-push_back - adds an element to the list from the end;
-pop_front - deletes an element in the list from the beginnin;
-pop_back -deletes an element from the end in the list
 ;

-reverse - Reverses the order of the elements in the List object.
-bubble_sort - Sorts the elements of the List object in ascending order using the bubble sort method.

-insertion_sort  -  Sorts the elements of the List object in ascending order using the insertion sort method.

This code implements a simple Cpu simulator. The Cpu has the following components:A Ram, which stores instructions and data.
A register file, which stores the Cpu'cpu registers.
A control unit (cu), which fetches instructions from RAM, decodes them, and executes them.
An arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which performs arithmetic and logical operations.The following table lists the operations that the Cpu can perform:
